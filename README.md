This is a recreation of a Vogue website that I've done for a friend. They're writing a story, and in one of the chapters there is a Vogue interview for the two main characters. I thought it would be fun
to put my HTML and CSS knowledge to the test and see if I could create an actual Vogue webpage for her. 

Languages used are HTML and CSS

Gitpages is hosting the webpage

*ongoing project*
