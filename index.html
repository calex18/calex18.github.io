            <!--Start of article-->
            <p>Despite the chaos of a Friday morning in LA, as Director and Executive Producer Agatha Harkness
                 walks into our studios had-in-hand with her very new wife, Rio, it appears as though not a lick
                of the insanity of mid-morning traffic or coffee lines has graced them.</p>
            <p>They are well aware of all the buzz that has been happening over the leaked photos 
                of their exclusive and very private wedding and while surprised, they both admit to simply taking it a day at a time.</p>
            <p>When on a trip to prepare for her latest film, the two met in Auckland, New Zealand, where Rio was living at the time.
                 When I ask them both to tell me about how they met, they turn to each other and grin, but Agatha is quick to take the lead.</p>
            <p>"<span style="font-style: italic">I</span> personally was not having the best day. A boardroom meeting had me a little out of sorts when I was on a trip for a new project.
                 It left me wandering around Auckland, New Zealand in the middle of the day mad as hell," she tells me, which sounds on-brand for her
                  typical iron-fist style of organizing her projects.</p>
            <p>As they sit with their hands locked between them, occasionally offering one another gentle grips of encouragement, she continues on.
                 "I was on the phone with a friend, griping about what I had been dealing with and had not been paying attention to where I was going. 
                 I apparently was not paying attention to the shouting happening around me, either."</p>
            <p>The more Agatha recants, the more she glances over at her wife, a smile occurring each time. She's looking directly at her when she speaks again.
                 "The only thing I heard clearly was a wolf whistle as I was crossing a bridge over the marina."</p>
            <p>This time, when she ventures forth, she looks directly at me with a disposition that I am sure I am the first reporter to ever see. She looks tame, reverent. Agatha looks 
                as though she's about to tell me how the universe came into existence.</p>
            <p>"I looked up, and across the water, there were a couple of houseboats. On the deck of one, there was a woman who looked like she'd just been lounging waving me down.
                 When I went to acknowledge her, someone on a bike hit me hard enough that I lost my balance and fell over the railing."</p>
            <p>The moment she tells me this, Agatha is grinning again, unable to stop herself from glancing to the woman at her side. When I request clarification as to whether or not she had 
                landed directly in the water, she confirms this with a curt nod, though there are jovial lights dancing in her vibrant blue eyes.</p>
            <p>"Right into it," she tells me firmly, though the slightly sheepish smile that finds her with another glance to her companion tells me there's still some residual embarrassment over 
                the initial meeting. "Launched my phone, was drenched... I was... not happy, but I swam over to climb out. I let her pull me onto the deck of her houseboat, and then she politely 
                informed me that I had been walking in the bike lane."</p>
            <p>The general consensus is that it takes a lot to not laugh at such a wild story, but we all three manage to keep going, this time as Rio speaks.</p>
            <p>"I had been reading on my deck that afternoon after an otherwise boring day when I heard shouting. It's not all that uncommon, as the bikers around the city are a lively bunch. 
                But... when I looked up, I saw why. I tried to get her attention, but the timing was poor, obviously," she remembers, a mildly wistful look in her beautiful green eyes. 
                The longer she speaks, the more prominent her primarily Kiwi accent becomes. "When I pulled her out, I felt a bit guilty, even though I knew it wasn't my fault. 
                Even more guilty when I realized I dropped my own phone while trying to help her out of the water."</p>
            <p>Listening to her explain this, it feels as though they're whisking me away to a time when technology and social media were merely a thought and nothing but human connection 
                and interaction ultimately prevailed.</p>
            <p>"So... I offered to dry her clothes for her so she could get on about her day. Which would have seemed like a normal and reasonable offer, but --" In the middle of her explaining, 
                Agatha does not miss a beat as she cuts in, her hand tightening around the one in her hold. "But her dryer hadn't been updated since the prehistoric ages and total run time was roughly three hours," 
                she divulges, as though it is the most outrageous fact of life anyone could ever state aloud.</p>
            <p>"Yes, that. So she showered and we wound up on the deck with wine," Rio tells me, though Agatha is looking like she's about to burst apart into beams of light as she watches her wife speak with vivid 
                fascination written all over her face. "We sat on the deck for hours, just... talking. About life, our children, and existentialism like we were discussing the weather."</p>
            <p>Agatha's head whips to me as she informs me of something that seems important to her. "Then she even cooked for me."</p>
            <p>Truly, in those moments I realize that I am seeing an entirely new facet of the Golden Ruler of Hollywood. For so long, she has treated the industry like her kingdom, monopolizing on her successes while 
                never once buckling in her surly and staunch rule. Here she sits in front of me, looking every bit of the in-love and softened version of herself that I believe is only visible when she is beside the woman 
                she had vowed to spend the rest of her life with. As Rio continues, there is a gentle reminiscent air that settles over the two of them, almost making them glow a little brighter. "We ate, talked more, drank more. 
                It was just... peaceful. By the time it had gotten dark and we finished eating, I knew it was likely that her clothes were dry. We went inside to check, and I was right. But then..."
                </p>
            <p>"Then," Rio begins, but I do not miss the way her hand has moved to Agatha's arm in a show of support and comfort. "Agatha took the glass of water she had been drinking and she threw it inside. She closed the door, 
                pressed the button and looked me right in the eye when she told me they needed more time."</p>
            <p>For someone who has developed a steeled and frozen demeanor throughout her twenty plus year long career, this is certainly a lighter and more romantic side to be witnessing and hearing about from the proclaimed Wild Witch of Hollywood.</p>
            <p>"We ended up watching a documentary and I fell asleep," Agatha decides to pick up, her eyes alight with the memory. "And the next morning when I woke up... She was making a breakfast that I knew I couldn't stay for. I knew that my assistant
                was likely losing his mind with no contact. The friend I had been on the phone with was probably terrified. I needed to put out those fires as soon as possible."</p>
            <p>As I listen, I envision how this goes. They exchange numbers, keep in touch, perhaps visit one another to keep things alive. I realize pretty quickly that I am very, very misguided.</p>
            <p>Agatha sits up a little straighter before she presses on, though what she has to say it a little more heartbreaking than any preparation would have been suitable for. "So, I got dressed in the dry clothes she had left folded for me and I went 
                out to greet her and then say my goodbyes. Which... Maybe it would have been normal if we were anyone else, but..."</p>
            <p>In the middle of her speaking, I watch with interest as Rio simply turns her head and beholds her wife with such understanding and respect that it is almost surreal to accept the idea that we as humans are capable of wearing an expression fueled by such an emotion.
                There is a slight hesitance between them, as if they know some big secret that they are not sure how to reveal, but Agatha finds a way to try. "But... When I went to thank her and offer farewells, I realized that I... I realized I did not know her name. And..."</p>
            <p>Before I am able to develop any questions to even try to ask, Rio is quick to fill the empty space.</p>
            <p>"And I panicked," she reveals.</p>
            <p>At this point, their arms are wound and their grip on one another's hands has not wavered even once through their retelling of their origins. "I turned the sentiment back on her and... We accidently set a precedent that we didn't mean to." Rio turns to look at me by the time Agatha speaks next.</p>
            <p>"And I left without knowing her name."</p>
            <p>Upon first sitting down with them, I am not quite so sure as to what it was that they were going to tell me, but that far into it, hearing that line causes the most heavy feeling to settle in my chest. I clearly can see that it is not where 
                their story ends, but hearing such a sentiment feels only half as devastating as I imagine it might have for them.</p>
            <p>It somehow hurts a little more when she informs me that she did not go back.</p>
